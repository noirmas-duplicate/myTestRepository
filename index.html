<h2>
    I've always been haunted by the question of <em>"How men managed to get to the moon?"</em>, the short answer is: <em>"It's rocket science"</em>, a more complex answer lies on the fine code written on to execute precise commands to land a man on the moon and bring him back. One of the pillards to acomplish it was the group of people who wrote the code and inspired younger generations to learn conputer science. I love math, coding has laways been on my bucket list, syntaxis is my main problem when writing code.
